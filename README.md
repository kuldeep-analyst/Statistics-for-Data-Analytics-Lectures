# 📊 Statistics for Data Analytics – Retail Customer Insights Project

This project is a comprehensive application of core statistics concepts used in data analytics, demonstrated through a practical use case: analyzing customer behavior in a retail dataset.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal is to apply statistical techniques step-by-step across 17 key lectures, using a synthetic dataset representing 1000 retail customers with features like demographics, purchases, loyalty, campaign responses, and more.
